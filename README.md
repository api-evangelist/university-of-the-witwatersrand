> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) is a leading public research university in Johannesburg, South Africa, ranked #268 in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This repository catalogs the institution's public, machine-readable developer/API footprint as an APIs.json (0.19) provider profile for the API Evangelist network. Wits has no central branded developer portal; the confirmed public surfaces are standards-based library and open-research interfaces.

- Website: https://www.wits.ac.za/
- Library: https://www.wits.ac.za/library/
- GitHub: https://github.com/WitsSoftDev (Wits Mathematical Sciences Software Development Group; departmental, not a central institutional org)
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-the-witwatersrand/

## Notes

- No-fabrication discipline applied. The WIReDSpace REST API root (DSpace 9.2) and OAI-PMH Identify response were both verified live.
- The Wits Open Data Vault is confirmed (launched 2025 on Figshare with Altmetric/Dimensions); the institutional Figshare portal returned HTTP 403 to automated fetches, so the Figshare public API and the official announcement page are linked instead of an institution-specific portal URL.
- No central Wits developer portal, open-data API gateway, or student/timetable/SIS API was found publicly documented. LibGuides/LibCal (Springshare) and identity/SSO systems exist but are vendor-hosted and gated.
- The official institutional GitHub organization could not be confirmed; only departmental/course orgs (e.g., WitsSoftDev, WITS-COMS3010) were found.
